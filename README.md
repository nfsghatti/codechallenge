# FizzBuzz Variation Challenge

## Objective
You will demonstrate your proficiency with Git by forking this repository, making changes, and submitting them as a pull request.

## Goal
The goal of this challenge is to implement a function that satisfies the **FizzBuzz** variation requirements. 
You will then extend this implementation with a loop to process numbers from 1 to 100 and Validate the output.


---

## Problem Statement
Create a function that takes an integer `n` and returns:
1. `"Fizz"` if the number is divisible by 3.
2. `"Buzz"` if the number is divisible by 5.
3. `"FizzBuzz"` if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
4. The number itself (as a string) if it is divisible by neither.

Additionally:
- Write a loop that calls this function for integers from 1 to 100 and outputs the results.

## Example Input and Output

### Function
| Input | Output    |
|-------|-----------|
| 3     | "Fizz"    |
| 5     | "Buzz"    |
| 15    | "FizzBuzz"|
| 7     | "7"       |

## Validate Output


## Push your changes
Once you have a stable state, create a PR for your changes.
